Prototype app#1:

premise: 
	The goal of the app is to design it to utilize programs and scripts and the simple press of a button,
	where instead of using wrappe functions, the code will call other languages/other porgrams to run it's function,
	much like my VIM_SIM program
	
	part1(the main interface):
		-the program will be password protected to ensure only I can use it, and 
		will be encrypted with a hash text file, for simplicities sake.
		
	class TheButtons: Bashdirectory, 
	{
		BashScripts():
			-Opens another user interface to display all the executable scripts via buttons.
			-These buttons are intended to be a 
			
		NotepadEditor():
			-allows the user to pull up a quick text file
				features():
					save
					del 
					open button 
		
	}
	
Do now: Finish designinig the user interface 
	-set up the line edit and password 
	-set up password access the program. ->this code will be in C, and store the password, having a script be called 
		with grep to check if the user password matches 
	-finish intstalling the buttons neccessary to run the user interface
