VIMSIM: FOR LINUX
      This was a fun program I made in my earlier days to mimic the classic VIM with a twist. The program allows you 
      to: Install a variety of compilers you may need, Execute different code in the directory of he program, Open 
      a file, read a file, write to a file via the terminal with whitespaces with a save option allowing you to 
      write code on the fly and save it to a desired file, as well as a manual for the program.
