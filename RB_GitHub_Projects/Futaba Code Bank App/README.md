This is a sample of a Code bank app I've written to host 6, going on 7, years of my research and experience as a self-taught software engineer. 
You'll notice after authenticating, a menu will appear, with a set of menu's and items. When you click on the menu item the program will open a text area
in which a file from it's destination will be read, in this case, code samples and guides intended to be packaged with the program. In this demo only the 
menu's and items are provided, but you can observer the code as well as run the app to get a sense of what it's suppossed to do. 

The main goal of this program is to get you caught up to speed with the basics you need to know when learning programming languages, and help carry over that 
patter when learning more languages in the future. I strictly filter out what is and isn't neccessary, so that people are able to focus and cover the basics
and start learning frameworks, of course learning more about the language as they go. Sometimes poeple learn everything possible about a language without really
thinking of the practicality of what they're learning. Realistically you need to be able to pick up languages and start writing in them like that. In the program 
I cover guides on 13 programming languages: C, C++, C#, Python3, Java, Arduino programming language/Electrical engineering, Bash Shell Scripting, PowerShell 
Scripting, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Assembly, as well as some MYSQL database programming (on Linux) as well as hosting sample code and notes, as well as my Cyber 
Security research. It's a product I plan on selling in the near future.
