Introduction:
    These are a set of projects I've selected that I felt best to display for 
    my professional portfolio. These projects are from my earlier years as a programmer, 
    pardon if the organization of the files is rather messy for the Python Application, I 
    have a README file in it to tell you how to use it and which code to run, install scripts
    handy if you need them. 

    I write and test my code on linux, so it's best done the same when running the code. I utilize
    the system command quite often for the linux terminal in my code, which is why you need 
    to run it in Linux. Thank you for taking the time to check out my GitHub.
